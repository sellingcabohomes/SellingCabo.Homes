## Key Market Shifts in August 2025

The numbers reveal three major changes happening right now in Los Cabos real estate:

**Inventory has exploded.** Active listings jumped 217% compared to August 2024. We went from a market where buyers fought over scraps to one where they actually have choices. This is the biggest inventory increase I've seen in years.

**High-end properties are still moving.** Total units sold dropped 3% year-to-date, but total sales volume increased 13%. The math is simple: fewer sales but higher prices. Luxury properties in prime locations continue to perform while lower-end inventory sits longer.

**Buyer activity remains steady.** 144 properties went under contract in August, up 8% from last year. The 1,358 year-to-date contracts show consistent demand despite the inventory surge.

## What This Actually Means

**For buyers:** You have leverage now. More inventory means less pressure to make snap decisions and more room to negotiate. The days of bidding wars over average properties are behind us.

**For sellers:** Your property needs to stand out. With more competition, pricing strategy and presentation matter more than they have in years. The market will still reward quality, but it won't forgive mediocrity.

## Understanding Mexican Real Estate Purchases

Market data only gets you so far. If you're serious about buying in Mexico, you need to understand the process:

* **[Los Cabos Closing Costs 2025](/los-cabos-closing-costs/)**: The complete breakdown of every expense you'll face.
* **[The Fideicomiso Decoded](/how-fideicomiso-works-mexico/)**: How foreigners legally own coastal property in Mexico.
* **[Blood, Land & Revolution](/history-of-fideicomiso-mexico-property-law/)**: The history behind Mexico's property ownership laws.
