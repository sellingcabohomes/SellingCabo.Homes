Most successful people I know want the same thing when it comes to vacation homes.



They want a beautiful place to escape with family and friends. Somewhere they can relax without worrying about booking hotels or dealing with rental properties that might disappoint.



But here's what stops most of them: they know they'll only use it 4-6 weeks per year, and they don't want to deal with rental management when they're not there.



So they keep renting. Or they invest in whole ownership for a second home and end up with a beautiful, expensive headache. It's a common challenge in the world of **luxury real estate**.



But there's a third option that most people have never heard of.



## You Might Be Wondering If There's A Smarter Way



![Stunning sunrise view of Land's End arch from a luxury vacation home balcony at Oceana Residence Club in Los Cabos.](/assets/cabo-hero-sunrise.jpeg)



Look, buying a whole vacation home makes sense for some people. If you're going to use it 12+ weeks per year, or you want to rent it out and manage tenants, go for it.



But what if you're like most busy professionals? You know you'll use it maybe 6 weeks per year. You have zero interest in becoming a long-distance landlord. And you'd rather not tie up $2 million in a single property.



That's where fractional ownership comes in.



Think of it like a country club. When you join a golf club, you don't buy specific tee times. You become a member with access to the whole club whenever you want to play.



Fractional ownership works the same way, except instead of golf, we're talking about luxury vacation homes.



## Why Smart Travelers Choose Fractional Ownership in Cabo



Let me share some stories from people who've made this switch.



Take the owner at The Christie Club in Steamboat Springs. He told us: "This is the only thing we've ever bought and never had buyer's remorse."



That's a pretty strong statement. But here's why he said it: he's getting more vacation time than he ever did with whole ownership, spending way less money, and he has zero management responsibilities.



Another owner at The Chateaux in Park City put it this way: "We didn't want to pay whole ownership prices, nor did we want the inconvenience of maintaining a second home located far away. Co-ownership solved both those problems."



And here's my favorite, from an owner at the Reefs Club in Bermuda: "The ease of ownership and service is outstanding. Staff bends over backwards to make your day better."



![Happy couple enjoying the benefits of fractional ownership at a luxury resort pool, showcasing a hassle-free vacation lifestyle.](/assets/luxury-lifestyle-couple.jpeg)



Notice what these people are talking about. They're not bragging about their real estate investment. They're talking about how much easier their lives became.



## Vacation More, Manage Less: How Fractional Ownership Works



Here's how fractional ownership actually works.



You buy a **deeded share** of a luxury residence. Usually 1/8th, which means there are 8 total owners per property.



But here's the key part: you're not stuck with 1/8th of the time. You can use it as much as you want, based on availability.



The company that pioneered this whole concept is called Elite Alliance. They've been doing this for over 30 years, with more than 60 successful projects and 10,000+ happy members.



Their track record includes partnerships with Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, and Waldorf Astoria properties in places like Aspen, Napa Valley, Manhattan, Tuscany, and Bermuda.



So this isn't some new, untested idea. It's a proven model that's been working for three decades.



Here's why it works so well: not everyone uses their vacation home the same amount. Some owners take 2-3 trips per year. Others take 8-10 trips.



The math works out because the people who use it less make room for the people who want to use it more.



## Is It Too Good to Be True? The 30-Year Track Record of Fractional Ownership



I know exactly how you feel. When I first heard about this, I thought the same thing.



In fact, most people feel that way initially. The whole concept seems almost too logical.



But here's what I found when I dug deeper: this model has been working successfully for 30+ years. Elite Alliance alone has over 10,000 members who are actively using this system.



And the satisfaction rates are through the roof. One owner at The Phillips Club in Manhattan said: "It's everything we thought it was going to be. I think it's an excellent investment."



Another owner at PGA West in California explained: "This is our way of owning a vacation home without having to deal with the responsibilities, but I didn't realize what a sophisticated experience it would be."



The reason people love it so much is simple: they get all the benefits of vacation home ownership with almost none of the hassles.



## Unlocking More Vacation Time: The Flexible Reservation System



The usage system is designed around how people actually vacation.



You get three types of reservations:



* **Planned Vacations**: Three weeks per year that you book well in advance. These are for your important dates - holidays, family reunions, special occasions. You can even book multiple residences at the same time if you're hosting a big group.



* **Space Available**: After everyone books their planned weeks, you have unlimited access to any remaining time. Most owners use this for 3-4 additional weeks per year.



* **Short Notice**: Spontaneous getaways within 15 days of travel. Perfect for last-minute escapes.



The only extra cost when you stay is a housekeeping fee. Everything else - maintenance, utilities, property taxes, insurance - is covered in your annual dues.



If all owners used the property equally, each would get about 6 weeks per year. But since some people use it less, others can use it more. Elite Alliance has members who stay 90+ days per year.



## Your Home Base for Global Travel: The Vacation Exchange Program



Here's where this gets really interesting: your fractional ownership includes access to Elite Alliance's exclusive **vacation home exchange program**.



They have 120+ luxury properties worldwide. You can deposit time at your home property and use those credits to stay at comparable places around the globe.



![Collage of global destinations available through the Elite Alliance vacation home exchange program, including Tuscany, Aspen, and the Caribbean.](/assets/elite-alliance-exchange-collage.jpg)



So you might spend winter at your home club in Cabo, spring in Tuscany, summer in Napa Valley, and fall in Manhattan. All from owning one fractional share.



Diane McGinnis, an owner at Grand Luxxe, explained it perfectly: "Elite Alliance has afforded me the benefit of being able to greatly expand my travel opportunities from depositing my time at my home club that I was unable to use."



The exchange fees are reasonable - typically $400-900 per week plus local housekeeping. Compare that to what you'd pay to rent luxury properties in those same destinations.



## Oceana: Your Private Residence Club Experience in Los Cabos



Elite Alliance is now bringing this proven model to Baja with the **Oceana Residence Club in Los Cabos**.



Oceana is the only five-star wellness residence in Los Cabos. The entire development is built around eight key wellness principles that make your time there genuinely restorative.



The acoustic comfort means you'll sleep better than you do at home. The advanced air filtration systems mean you'll breathe cleaner air. The thermal design keeps your residence cool without cranking the AC.



They've thought of everything: motion-activated lighting, solar panels to keep community costs low, even trash chutes so you never smell garbage.



Your residence comes fully furnished with German windows, Spanish porcelain floors, Silestone countertops, and GE appliances. Everything is turnkey.



![Turnkey luxury living room at Oceana Residence Club with modern furnishings and a panoramic ocean view in Los Cabos.](/assets/oceana-residence-interior.jpeg)



The amenities include a spa, state-of-the-art gym, multiple pools, tennis court, restaurant, and co-working spaces. Plus concierge service, car wash, and grocery shopping service.



Two ownership levels are available:



**Club Grand** (3BR/2,367 sq ft): Starting at $159,000  

**Club Penthouse** (3BR/4,842 sq ft): Starting at $269,000



Your annual dues run about $10,000, which covers everything - maintenance, utilities, property taxes, insurance, reserves, and professional management.



Compare that to whole ownership at Oceana, which would cost $800,000 to $1.6 million, plus $15,000-25,000 annually in expenses, plus all the management headaches.



## Addressing Your Top Concerns About Fractional Ownership



### "What if I can't get the dates I want?"



Elite Alliance clubs have a 90%+ satisfaction rate for desired dates. The system rotates priority each year so everyone gets access to peak times. Plus you can book multiple types of reservations simultaneously.



### "How do I know this will hold its value?"



Fractional ownership follows the same appreciation patterns as whole ownership real estate. You own a deeded interest that can be sold on the MLS like any other property. Elite Alliance provides professional resale support.



### "Is this just a fancy timeshare?"



Not even close. Timeshares are right-to-use programs that depreciate immediately. This is deeded real estate ownership with **unlimited flexible usage**. You own an asset, not vacation time.

*For a complete breakdown of the five key differences, see our in-depth* <a href="/fractional-ownership-vs-timeshare/">*comparison of fractional ownership vs. timeshares in Los Cabos*</a>.



### "What about the other owners?"



You never interact with other owners' belongings. Professional staff maintains everything to five-star standards. Most owners end up becoming friends because they share similar values and lifestyles.



## Your Next Step: Get the Insider's Webinar & Tour



If this sounds interesting, I have something special for you.



I recorded an exclusive webinar with Nick Fong (owner of Ronival Real Estate) and Rob Goodyear (founder of Elite Alliance) where they explain exactly how fractional ownership works and answer real questions from other potential buyers.



This isn't available to the general public - just fill out the form below and I'll send you the private access link.



After you watch it, I'll call you personally to answer any additional questions and, if it makes sense, arrange your VIP tour of Oceana.

Or if you prefer to talk first, call me directly at +52 624 119 4526.



Early buyers get immediate access to Elite Alliance's exchange program, so you can start using other properties worldwide even before Oceana is completed.



The people I quoted earlier didn't stumble into fractional ownership. They made a deliberate choice to prioritize experience over hassles, flexibility over anchoring, and lifestyle over logistics.



Your new way of vacationing is waiting.

**P.S.** In case you skipped to the end (I do that too), here's what this is about:



A proven way to own luxury vacation homes that lets you travel more while spending less. You buy a fractional share instead of the whole property, so you get all the benefits with none of the headaches.



Elite Alliance has been perfecting this model for 30+ years with 10,000+ satisfied members. Now they're bringing it to Los Cabos with Oceana Residence Club.



If you're tired of expensive rentals but don't want the hassles of whole ownership, this might be exactly what you've been looking for.

## An In-Depth Guide: Your Fractional Ownership Questions Answered



### What is Deeded Fractional Ownership?


Deeded fractional ownership is a form of direct property ownership where you buy a tangible share of the real estate (e.g., 1/8th). Your name is on the title deed, making you a legal co-owner. It's a real estate asset you can sell, gift, or will, and it can appreciate in value like a traditional home.



### What is the difference between <a href="/fractional-ownership-vs-timeshare/">fractional ownership vs timeshare</a>?


The difference is fundamental. A timeshare sells you the *right to use* a property for a set time, which is a depreciating product. Deeded fractional ownership is a *real estate investment*. You are buying an actual share of the property, an asset with resale value, making it a superior alternative to timeshares.



### How can foreigners (like US & Canadian citizens) legally own property in Cabo?


Foreigners can securely own property in coastal regions like Los Cabos through a legal trust called a *<a href="/how-fideicomiso-works-mexico/">**fideicomiso**</a>*. A Mexican bank holds the title in trust for you, the beneficiary. You have all the rights of ownership: to use, enjoy, and sell the property. This is a standard, safe, and federally approved process for foreign real estate investment in Mexico.


### What is a Private Residence Club (PRC)?


A Private Residence Club is the highest tier of fractional ownership, focused on ultra-luxury properties, five-star amenities, and personalized service (like concierge and daily housekeeping). Oceana Residence Club is a PRC, combining the financial benefits of co-ownership with the service of a world-class resort.


### Is fractional ownership a good investment?


While no real estate is guaranteed to appreciate, a fractional ownership investment has major advantages. Its value is tied to the <a href="/los-cabos-real-estate-market-report-august-2025/">local real estate market</a>, just like whole ownership. By sharing costs, you mitigate risk and can enter a luxury market like Los Cabos for a fraction of the price, potentially leading to a better return on investment (ROI) and a clear exit strategy.


### What are the true costs compared to owning a second home?


The primary benefit is avoiding the high, unpredictable costs of vacation homes. With whole ownership, you bear 100% of property taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance. With fractional ownership at Oceana, these expenses are divided among co-owners and covered by predictable annual dues, eliminating the financial stress and the <a href="/los-cabos-real-estate-buyers-guide/">hassle of owning a second home</a>.


### What happens if I want to sell my fractional share?

Because this is a deeded asset, you can sell your share at any time. Your interest can be listed on the MLS just like any other piece of real estate. Elite Alliance provides professional resale support to ensure a smooth and profitable process, connecting you with qualified buyers looking to join the club.


### Can I get financing for fractional ownership in Mexico?

Yes, financing is more accessible than ever. While traditional international mortgages can be complex, modern solutions are designed for speed. For example, a service like The <a href="https://www.moxianywhere.com/ronival?utm_source=websiteblog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=fractional">Anywhere Loan by MoXi®</a> is specifically for Americans and Canadians buying property in Mexico. Based on your home country credit (typically 700+), qualified buyers can secure financing in as little as 48 hours. This allows you to act like a cash buyer, which is a huge advantage. It's a streamlined way to own your piece of Oceana without the typical foreign banking hurdles.


### What are the wellness real estate features at Oceana?


Oceana is a pioneer in **wellness real estate** in Mexico, designed as a true **healthy living home**. This goes far beyond a simple gym or spa. The entire residence is engineered to proactively improve your well-being with features like:


<ul> <li><strong>Advanced Air Filtration:</strong> Hospital-grade HEPA filters remove allergens, dust, and pollutants, ensuring the air you breathe is pristine.</li> <li><strong>Purified Water Systems:</strong> Multi-stage water purification delivers pure, great-tasting water from every tap.</li> <li><strong>Biophilic Design:</strong> The architecture is designed to connect you with nature, which is proven to reduce stress and improve mental clarity.</li> <li><strong>Circadian Lighting:</strong> Specialized lighting systems are designed to work with your body’s natural rhythm, helping you sleep deeper and wake up more refreshed.</li> <li><strong>Acoustic Comfort:</strong> Superior soundproofing and materials create a tranquil environment, shielding you from outside noise. These scientifically-backed features make your home at Oceana a restorative sanctuary.</li> </ul>


### How does the vacation home exchange program work?

Your ownership at Oceana includes exclusive access to the Elite Alliance **vacation home exchange program**, which provides ultimate travel flexibility. The system is simple:


<ul> <li><strong>Deposit Time:</strong> You can deposit weeks of your planned vacation time from Oceana into the exchange.</li> <li><strong>Receive Credits:</strong> In return, you receive "Elite Credits" that act as your currency for global travel.</li> <li><strong>Travel the World:</strong> You can then use these credits to book stays at over 120 other prestigious, five-star resorts and residence clubs in destinations like Tuscany, Aspen, Napa Valley, and the Caribbean.</li> </ul>


This program transforms your single ownership stake into a passport for global travel, allowing you to explore the world while enjoying the five-star quality you expect, all for a fraction of what it would cost to rent those properties directly.

### Can I rent out my planned vacation weeks if I can't use them?

Yes, you have that flexibility. Owners can choose to rent out some of their planned vacation weeks to help offset annual dues. This is just one of several ways to maximize the value of your asset. If you have unused time, you can also deposit a week into the Elite Alliance exchange program to receive travel credits for use at over 120 other luxury properties worldwide.

### What are the typical annual property taxes (predial) for a fractional share?

For owners, there are no separate property tax bills to worry about. One of the key benefits of this ownership model is that all ongoing expenses are consolidated into a single, predictable annual due. This all-inclusive fee covers everything: property taxes (predial), insurance, utilities, professional management, maintenance, and contributions to a reserve fund for future replacements. It's designed for truly hassle-free ownership.

### Can friends or family use my time at the residence club without me?

Absolutely. As an owner, you have the privilege of sending unaccompanied guests, allowing your friends and family to enjoy your property even when you are not there. Furthermore, the system is designed to accommodate large groups. For a family reunion or special event, you can reserve multiple residences at your home club for the same week, ensuring everyone can stay together in five-star comfort.

### What happens to the property after the initial trust (fideicomiso) term ends?

Your deeded ownership is held securely in a government-approved bank trust known as a fideicomiso. While the initial term for a fideicomiso is 50 years, it is renewable by law for subsequent 50-year periods. This is a standard and secure process. It ensures stable, long-term ownership that can be sold, willed, or gifted, securing your family's legacy asset in Los Cabos for generations to come.
